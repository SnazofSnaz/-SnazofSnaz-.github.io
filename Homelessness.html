        <p>Orange county particularly Irvine faces rapid growth. Potentially rapid growth leads to representing monoculture. Concerns such as these manifest through conflicts with homelessness, housing developments, education system incentives, and disproportionate suicide increase. Irvine is considered one of many pre-planned cities. Renowned as a master-planned city with township and village themed centers. Unlike cities of less planning; significant infrastructure is built into roadways as part of its pre-planned design for a seamless appearance. Infrastructure such as power lines, telephone lines, and utilities. Residential is often very visibly separate from commercial zoning. Each township also is demarcated by its own architectural styling, visible to an architecturally attentive eye. Furthering concerns of monoculture are symbolism of Irvine’s seamlessness representational of an overall city held ideal desire for integration. This integration boasted by Irvine’s recognition of 75 different languages represented. though townships are visibly insular, an encompassing communal design. Overarching principle of communalism makes contrast much more apparent. This contrast of seamlessness with under-reported concerns of, homeless erasure, housing inequality, suicide, and education incentivization will be intrinsic to representing struggles for the future of Orange County’s Irvine. For Irvine to continue developing prosperously attention to inter-relatability of these concerns must be addressed.</p>
        <p>Irvine’s most notable dilemma of late is homelessness or at times a lack thereof within its county limits, due to erasure. For example, a homeless person seen visibly outside say, a Walmart, will not be present the following day. Students of UCI noted “Irvine has cultivated an indifference to real-life suffering.” (Sydney). “The people of Irvine, like many in affluent or middle-class neighborhoods, have a false perception of the world. There is an invisible and visible barrier, a clear distinction between the wealthy and those living in poverty, hiding the struggles of the people who live in desperate environments.” (Sydney). Essential is recognizing correlation of seamlessness of Irvine’s communalism tentatively equates to capacity for erasure of homelessness thus, related concerns. Furthermore, seamlessness also makes homeless persons much more apparent, or questions of persons residential status a likely tool for vetting undesirable qualities for enforcement of social norms. Unlike many communities, Irvine’s response to homelessness is combative. Combative is Irvine’s stance as per city council meetings no effort for supporting homeless persons was made by residents. Furthermore, no accommodation efforts brought to city council by members criticizing availability of housing for homeless people are encouraged. Supporting this aggressive approach is knowledge that Orange County and its constituent county Irvine offer the fewest mental health facilities. Unfortunately, current method of erasure is a lose-lose scenario as economists do not claim erasure is beneficial from a tax payer perspective. Arguably this culture of thought requires change as mental health facilities often times cost far less, almost a third of current erasure culture. Seeing this is economically proven then, the culture itself must be to blame. Symbolic of this lack of accessible housing and alternative lifestyles identifiable as a monoculture driven identity of which homelessness does not fit. This monoculture showcased by nature of citizens united front against homelessness. Residents did not notably conflict with one another regarding remedy for homelessness. Constituents turned their attention towards ire demonstrated by refusal rather than rehabilitative planning. Principally, remedies for homeless persons already notably neglected by county supervisors. A main concern for this argument is intersection between interests of home equity and housing development for profits. What can be done for homeless people without injuring the current residents home valuation. Distressingly, helping homeless people and increasing home equity are generally considered divergent courses of action.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Irvine housing development corresponds distinctly with immigration to Irvine. From 2010 to 2018 Irvine’s population grew from 212,375 persons to estimates of 276,176 persons. Should be no surprise with overcrowding and a desire for home equity that people would be resistant to encroaching homelessness. Irvine’s distinct interest towards monoculture is most deftly represented through mayor Steven Choi’s pro-development platform. Representationally pro development platforms are known for encouraging immigration. Correspondingly evident is this active encouragement, inherently due to housing costs and development evaluations, remains for wealthy persons symbolizing development of monoculture. Though monoculture is often a natural response for persons immigrating such as, arrivals to Ellis Island during the 19th century, that was happenstance rather than planned. Is notable that people would like one another to carry their own weight, but, if people falter is not a question Irvine is ready to answer. Generally held belief is Irvine does not make people wealthy but, the wealthy make Irvine wealthy. Given that homeless people are not considerably wealthy, should be no surprise why residents would call to arms regarding loss of perceived wealth. Distorting is this contradiction of Americana displaying itself as a place for an American Dream yet, offering questionable resources to accomplish such a dream beyond resources already available to potential immigrating residents. Data shows repeatedly that diversity is not being broadened within Irvine it is being reduced. This reduction takes place because Irvine, due to its development structure, only allows for moving in of people from similar socio-economic statuses as those currently residing within its county. Paired with a lack of mental health facilities or supplemental housing, would be difficult arguing Irvine makes much effort towards needs of homeless or disenfranchised persons.</p>
        <p>Unsurprisingly, rates of demographic growth and ire towards homelessness coincide with values towards those unable to meet criteria of established residents with resultant suicides. Orange County has one of the highest dependencies on credit for currency nationally. About 80% of wealth distribution is credit purchase related, meaning credit is basis of monetary relation. To understand the intersection of these seemingly unconnected parts requires looking at suicide within other cultures, farmers for example. If a farmer’s crops are devastated after taking out a financial loan, is very common for a farmer to commit suicide. Similarly, within context of high stakes business where many people afford the conditions of which residence is attained here, suicide may seem the most prudent option. This statistic is veritable among studies showcasing data of suicide rates within Orange County where 70% of suicides are white males between ages of 24 – 69. Notably these suicides occur as a result of economic circumstances. Circumstances such as people living a currency of credit lifestyle creating a despair seemingly insurmountable. Should then be no surprise that so many residents would turn onto homeless persons, persons with little financial foothold. This combative approach representational of perhaps a fear deniable of residents to be seen comparably. Though appearing more lucrative are very often just as fiscally fragile, fragility being credit dependency. Though food may be on the table for some of Irvine, is difficult to know the circumstances leading to that food being present. Is believed arguing for pro-growth can only be tenable for so long before a capacity is reached. Through searching for peak capacity via encouraged monoculture a disinterest towards recognizing personal frailty is fostered disabling capacity for vision of external frailty. Paramount is seeing this omission of viewing frailty is a connection between increasing suicide risk and decrease of housing for the homeless. To give access to homeless people gives rise to belief that a normalcy to homelessness could exist. A normalizing of persons potential for recognizing frailty unlike what may be demonstrated by Irvine’s tantamount educational prestige.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ironically Irvine boasts one of the strongest education systems. “Irvine students consistently lead Orange County in SAT test scores, and more than 90 percent of their high school graduates attend college.” (Irvine). Considering such educational focus should be shocking that no educated determination for ending homelessness arises! Strong consideration for this is of all Irvine graduates, 10% study social sciences. Social sciences may not necessarily be regarding homelessness. When considering the rest of bachelor’s degree demographics are 42% involved with business or science and engineering, should be no surprise an answer to homelessness is not readily available. 4% of bachelor’s degrees from Irvine are in psychology, relating directly to an insubstantive number of mental health facilities. These statistics are only further indicative not only of Irvine’s disinterest towards concerns of homelessness and social wellbeing, but also a general societal disregard. If statistics of these types represent a typical environment wherein extensive educational investments correlate with successful college degrees does this signify educated results would be synonymous with social well-being results? An essential consideration when addressing Irvine’s educational system should be observed on basis of alignment of educational investment with actual improvement of community members’ living conditions. To broaden this sentiment, more education as related to personal wellness would seem fitting as evidence of its efficacy is growing. Admittedly if such advanced degree attainment can encourage empathy this phenomenon is indicative of broader beneficial educational investment. Otherwise, it is glaringly obvious communities such as Irvine may be deeply misaligned with their investment strategies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, Irvine’s development trend of monoculture driven results directly to issues of homelessness and suicide. This monoculture driven issue creates significant dilemmas within broader Orange County’s housing markets and educational resources. Overall housing market impact and educational availability discrepancies reflect a correlation with social wellbeing metrics and its improvement. As an educated community, investment towards social well-being should see positive results for homelessness. Unfortunately, only progressive investments towards the nature of treating the disenfranchised through community integration will likely be viable solutions for these pressing concerns. Resulting moral imperative is, effective investment of educated capabilities must be attained for balanced social equality and effectiveness within existing socio-economic structures.</p>
