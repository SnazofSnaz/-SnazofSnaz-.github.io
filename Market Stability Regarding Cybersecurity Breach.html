<p>Cyber-attacks create dramatic impact upon stability of stock markets nationally and internationally. Cyber-attacks are currently recognized per short term impacts as result of &ldquo;opportunistic trading&rdquo; &ndash; Important to scope of this paper is recognizing long term impact of actions resulting from generally considered short term opportunism. Recognition will be to better evaluate effective, comprehensive, justifiable response of and for data breach related cyber security. Achieving expressed recognition is possible by examining records of multiple research journals and news reports. Examination correlates recession events of companies experiencing cyber-attack related data breaches not only months prior event to damages years after event with potential of additional cyber-attack related opportunistic trading previously unrecognized. In short, results show a company and market suffer not only short-term impacts of data breach trading opportunism; the effects are also long term, though not only directly resultant of impact to product consumer or investor of data breached company. Evidenced of the long-term effect is investors developing platforms for seeking indemnification for themselves by a company for data breach and/or opportunistic trading events over an extensive timeframe of years. Yet less recognized is the contrast of damage to legal proceedings versus immediate impact of data breach. Unknown as of writing is whether data regarding data breaches and opportunistic trades occurring post initial data breach as result of indemnification action or prior indemnification periods is conducted by investors as stocks typically drop substantially within this time frame without corroborating data; potentially obfuscating initial research. Inquiry with increased depth of review regarding trade history correlating impact of data breach periods relative to initial catalyst could most likely amplify elaboration and development of remediations suggestions here within. Remediation intends to be akin holistic healthcare: preventative and reactive, though these identities are not exclusionary of one another, certain granularity of understanding determines nuance for recommending prior approach pre the latter. Approach within intends recognition for reduction of market instability. Statistical monitoring algorithms coupled with bureaucratic oversight adjustment could intrinsically ameliorate integrity of companies reducing susceptibility to opportunistic trades both pre and post initial data breach or opportunism catalyst resulting in and resultant of indemnifying action. Exploring preventative and reactive options may intertwine and diverge at points involving discussion such as artificial intelligence and proceedings related to SEC actionability. Bureaucratic response such as freezing a company stock in market is a possible prevention, additionally a reaction as the prevention is to stop damage much like a cyber security professional might power off a device to stop a network attack. Reactive in how recognition occurs requires a reaction, as a means of patching perimeter defense opening, an opening generally best kept closed. Per this example, damage to a market stock is relatively speaking, network walls. Freezing is also a reaction as freezing could foreseeably be contingent upon a data stream, set, or live action. Examination and development of research herewith in will attempt to delineate granularity or nuance for such distinctions as process per suggestions of remediation.</p>
<p>To better understand difficulties of addressing opportunistic trading consider publicly traded companies comprise one fiftieth of all opportunistic trading incidents. (Lin Sapp, Ulmer, Parsa) To this end, risk of trading publicly vs privately varies as publicly traded companies give annual, quarterly, seasonal, et al. reports to the public whereas privately held companies typically may not. (Open Shares Blog) Additionally, and perhaps intuitive relative to prior point is many rulings of SEC jurisdiction hold public and private companies to differing standards of accountability. (Tech Republic 2017) Per contrasting this identification, incidence of public vs private opportunistic trading information is not as readily available as publicly traded companies report more information. Impact of privately held company data breaches are generally contained further away from public purview. Reasoning of referenced research main tenet regarding opportunistic trading is examining public company data to evaluate how public company data reflects private company patterns. Examining public company data allows for qualifying impacts and creating paradigms. Paradigms for predicting private company investor trading patterns per public company investor trading patterns is then useful for developing parallels recognizing pre, post, and current market behaviors. Company example Equifax as discussed as case for recognizing disparity for time of breach to legal action is examined through various stock trading tools; models for patterning behavior were and are created to examine publicly and privately managed companies in tandem by applying pattern recognition for aforementioned parallels. Endeavor of investigating privately traded company parameters alongside data of publicly traded companies illuminates opportunities towards market stability ideation. Assessing private companies could increase stability as private company data breaches are more frequent than public company breaches. Effectively identifying parallels between public and private companies of opportunistic trades with public company information and evaluating motives for existence of these parallels is crucial for developing comprehensive operational chain transformation for increasing market stability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elaborating impacts of data breaches ideation intends to be a holistic approach suggesting intent is most likely capable of shifting narrative away from punitive or criminalizing schemas as suggested by citation identifying correlations of position to increased opportunism. Is unclear that increased SEC punitive measures will ameliorate insider trading as researchers suggested. Many suffer for results of opportunistic trades as well as their causes. Unlike previous research, the gains from opportunistic trades are or can be short lived rather than long term gains as a company rebounds from decline. Both opportunistic trading and increased punitive measures could have negative results as fear can also increase instability. (News Desk 2018) &ldquo;This has a damaging effect on the market&rsquo;s integrity as a system, and taking this line of thought further, it can lead to many participants being driven away from it [stock exchange] altogether.&rdquo; concerns not explored in depth here imply strong need for alternatives to punitive response towards rehabilitative response. Additionally, research gives reason to believe alternative means must be demonstrated as the long-term aggregate damage discovered herein is market instability; Though individual opportunistic traders may understand how to use stock market tools and resources, they however may not understand the implications of their actions at large as fear is generally a mechanism of self-preservation. Complicating market stability is better stemmed than allowed and complication may result by increasing punitive damages. Redirection from punitive action is not to argue against legal measures such as treble law, or other indemnifying action. Though such legal actions are potentially more destabilizing than damages such actions are response to; merit is recognized despite speculated risk. Primary idea is all spectrums of criminal or criminalized behavior roots causes could be: Identified, mitigated, decriminalized reducing suffering. Though an action may be considered abhorrent, destructive, unsupportive does not necessarily mean person should be persecuted so much as diagnosed and treated. Reduction of suffering is motivating this consideration and should be kept at forefront, even with indemnification measures applied. Showcasing need for alternative response is those who are caught conducting opportunistic trades often see less &ldquo;savings&rdquo; per their trade than if not conducting opportunistic trading, this if excluding exchanges such as put options. (Department of Justice) Put options as evidenced by Equifax former manager at face value seem greedy; like alternative choices for opportunistic trade stem from a general perception per many cases may be misguided. Misguided by trader acting with saving mentality implies more likely a fear component driving opportunism rather than a long-term aggregate or logical component. Additionally, members conducting these opportunistic trades may also be responsible for such trades being required of them as they may soon find themselves out of a job creating if statement of action. If potentially responsible for data breach due to incorrect action; then increase likelihood of opportunistic trading. A lack of logical reasoning then compounds to the market as signaling of their behavior can be monitored as well as those caught often incur fines far exceeding the value if not only negating the income of their opportunism. Given existent conditions are not stopping opportunistic trading as well as these conditions potentially increasing instability rather than decreasing suggest need for alternative response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, alternative response can take many forms as previously mentioned. One such form is data analysis algorithm utilizing existing data to detect patterns of trading by sorting and cycling through trades of companies to predict opportunistic trades through evaluating market history and correlating with SEC trade late filing dates. Studies such as (Lin, Sapp, Ulmer, Parsa) that opportunistic trading can be predicted by analyzing history of stock market trades of individuals associated with companies experiencing cyber-attack and/or data breaches. Evidenced and argued is that those generally considered influential members of companies privy privileged, publicly undisclosed information. Publicly undisclosed information such as knowledge of cyber-attack, and/or being the insider/informant allowing cyber-attack occurring to then access privileged information for selling of stock before company incurs damage; damage for purposes of this paper generally being of a fiscal nature inherently market stability. Example being an Equifax manager in 2017 utilized put options and was charged in 2018 for making those opportunistic trades or rather trades with knowledge of security breach. (SEC) As mentioned briefly prior, put options increase in value as an asset&rsquo;s value falls. (Kuepper 2020) Though potentially this manager&rsquo;s actions were greed based, I argue fear is a strong component of what many generally perceive as greed. Knowing a company value is about to decrease also signifies a person&rsquo;s position of employ may be at risk. Consideration that a data breach can and does cause a plethora of systemic changes for a victim corporation climate as well as industry such a corporation is category of; securing wealth, from this reasoning, is then potentially a compensatory response of fear for future of one&rsquo;s livelihood. Influencing this speculative conclusion is the SEC&rsquo;s seemingly compassionate sentencing of perpetrator per this referenced opportunistic trade. Given the SEC sentencing was to return put option trade gains with interest, it is arguable within scope of SEC reasoning that preventative measures would be well received. (SEC) Fear driven and illogical basis for opportunism such as these mentioned incidence categories are premise for increasing monitoring and information gathering of this realm regarding opportunistic trading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Continuing with knowledge of mentioned gains of management with Equifax, research also identifies certain job titles are experiencing or are found more likely to experience greater amounts of profit or &ldquo;savings&rdquo; for opportunistic trading. (Lin, Sapp, Ulmer, Parsa) How these varying job titles relate psychological factors as mentioned is technically unknown, though speculation is the impact, the thought of loss encourages opportunism. Awareness of impending loss is more palpable to responsible parties of potential loss thus increasing risk engendering sensibility of fear regarding impending financial dissonance. Regardless, shifting away from speculation to known is an increased risk relative to title and potential causes are identified. Identification then leads to a stronger premise for potential remediation such as utilization of artificial intelligence or statistical data monitoring. Artificial intelligence is capable of accurately predicting ten of ten trades successfully regarding opportunism. (Baabor) Using this same algorithmic methodology to make successful trades could be paired with existent research related to monitoring history of certain individual&rsquo;s trades compared against history of their trading portfolios. Artificial intelligence predicting successful opportunistic trades could pair with SEC database of late filings as research has shown those committing opportunistic trades also file their SEC paperwork late. With this combinatorial of factors what could result is a strong monitor alternative deterring or preventing opportunistic trading. Monitoring may be accomplished by combining what researchers already established such as measuring known values incrementally for variables related to opportunistic trading colloquially known as flags. Flags being late filings, inconsistent trading, data breach notifications reported to SEC. Such technology could mitigate if not altogether prevent various opportunistic trading as reported herein. Prevention of this nature would tentatively reduce need for punitive action such as treble law, class actions, or SEC compliance lawsuits as intrinsic to such sensibility is decreased risk; the amount of potential damage incurred by opportunistic trades would be mitigated perhaps leading to a plethora of incentives such as decreased insurances, judicial overhead. Starkness of value is observable if following Equifax stock values at times of data breach analysis capable of supporting lawsuit judgements contrasted with Equifax initial data breach. [Figure 1-1] [Figure 1-2] Without such knowledge method of increased monitoring could be considered over-zealous as it is an archetype of big brother mentality. Unfortunately, opportunistic trades and data breaches create impractical to solve unknown variables regarding consumer impact warranting such methodology. Reduction of unknown variables likely would increase market stability thus, increase confidence for suggesting increased monitoring as remediation. (Michigan Law Review 2002) Methodology to this end could decrease risk of human error like Equifax information security. &ldquo;Equifax&apos;s information security department ran scans on March 15, 2017 that were meant to identify systems that were vulnerable to the Apache Struts issue, but the scans did not identify the vulnerability.&rdquo; (Center E.P.I) Equifax vulnerability was known, sought, and unfortunately overlooked for several months. Though Equifax breach is potentially, intentionally, internally manufactured &ndash; this increases monitoring justification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Increased monitoring could also disallow choice of becoming threat actor to company security. Threat actor for such case may cause legal proceedings as class actions, opportunistic trades, and negligence such that Equifax incurred/experienced can be lucrative to plaintiffs and plaintiff representation and potentially Equifax itself. Undetermined cost of such implementation defines suggestion limitation be warranted for most likely able to commit insider/outsider &ldquo;opportunistic trades.&rdquo; Additionally, given, privileged information is also sold, as is case made per Equifax lawsuits regarding consumer data; application of such methodology if feasible would be recommended for overall purchase and sale of company stock. Overall goal here is as stated prior; monitor with intent to intervene more preventatively rather than reactively to avoid legal case development. Given these methods do not prevent data breaches, it is evidentiary from findings legal action alongside data breach information disclosure coincides directly with data breach causing stock reduction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four days after Equifax data breach announcement lawsuit is announced by self-representing claimants. (Tirell, Marino) Notably is evidence post data breach capable of supporting potential lawsuit then leads to increased uncertainty surrounding market stability causing decreases of stock value. (The Equifax Data Breach) [figure 1-2] To be clear, the instability is from breach causing uncertainty then amplified by legal proceedings rather than cost of or existence of legal battle as evidenced with settlement of January 2020 (Equifax) [figure 1-3] This leads to concerns regarding class action as value to process. Compounding this concern is questionable value to constituent parties as cash out value per person decreased with every claimant to approximately seven cents if all opt in as a settlement amount is declared regardless of claims made. (Hollister 2019) Majority of cost went to penalties most likely covering costs rectifying identity theft through SEC resources and covering government review costs. Reducing these costs intervention could require freezing company stock per persons holding company stock as previously recommended. Freeze could act as a tourniquet preventing &ldquo;market instability signaling&rdquo; and fiscal bleeding from opportunistic trades. Is unclear how much a primary authority [such as chief information officer] action signals to fellow investors or stockholders however, given the nature of this research focus being unknown variable decreasing amounts to increased stability, such freeze is warranted. Reducing this signaling via suggesting freezing could then reduce such variance increasing market stability as SEC law portends via illegalizing opportunistic trading. A method of freezing such as this is instituted by the SEC prior information release for new technologies or products considered capable of dramatically affecting company stock analysis. Idea could link code to artificial intelligence or statistical data analysis tools to alert monitoring personnel of SCE or related entity encouraging institution of a discreet &ldquo;cyber-attack freeze&rdquo; with title such as &ldquo;information disclosure event&rdquo; This could be changed as research argues to target individual stockholders who access privileged information, however, given that information is valued or sellable, a more cohesive approach would be to freeze stock for the company entirely. Mentioned remediation ideation only be recommended per case monitoring of company stock profile confirms opportunistic trade or related data breach rather than if remediation is expanded beyond monitoring specific high-risk individuals of such a company as Equifax.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional consideration must be given to disclosure of information &ndash; Equifax was found at fault multiple times for distribution of information being easily hampered or prone to cyber-attack such as spoofing. Though Equifax is a public company apparent is white hat or grey hat hacker support directly rather than a sort of public shaming (Deahl) would substantially benefit market stability. Though this breach was not immediately disclosed, efforts were made to amend issue as advised making clear concern of handling. Remediation to market stability may also take form of inquiry regarding efficacy of legal reactions per this event could be beneficial &ndash; a cost benefit analysis for consumer regarding legal action may benefit from increased consideration. Albeit many persons constituting plaintiff regarding Equifax data breach are not exclusively investors is apparent legal action results may not be of particular benefit to market stability or consumer plaintiffs. Questionable is benefit regarding legal handlings of this nature particularly for case of Equifax. Supporting counsel to seek a cost benefit analysis as part of discovery to justify litigation is recommended for future data breach events as such legal actions may cause more duress than benefit. Unverified yet, believed is increasing duress may not been necessary, advised, or entirely warranted toward handling of this event. Class action legal counsel was not responsible for handling of fallout to extent SEC is for this event and many free credit monitoring reports were and are already available as remediation. Availability of credit reporting tools, many offered by Equifax at time of proceedings acted as a prevention itself to the nature of the data breach. Seeing as Equifax is in the market to detect such fallout legal case may not been required to generate this response. Inherently Equifax is and was in the market of righting itself. Unfortunately, this last remediation also recognizes Equifax created more work for itself experiencing this data leak making questionable backstory regarding data breach occurrence. Remediation to this end may suggest diffusing large credit bureaus to smaller bureaus or branches of reporting for storing data and reporting credit with varying data structures to reduce likelihood of such recurrence.</p>

<p>Figure 1-1 week of Equifax data breach announcement and beginning of filing class action claims. Uncertainty is most notable at this point. (Tirell, Merino) This expresses potential to correlate proceeding figures and research abstraction attributing data breach to uncertainty causing market instability such as this decrease of value. Note this drop may have been sharper had announcement not taken place during a weekend and inquire whether releasing cyber related information prior to weekend impacts stock stability.</p>

<p>Figure 1-2 the date Equifax data breach analysis is released &ndash; creating more uncertainty and substantiating evidence for class action lawsuits conducted at this time. Conflict creates more uncertainty reducing market stability. (Equifax Data Breach) Is important to recognize person&rsquo;s investing and surrounding public may not understand language of material released at this time. Per reading appears individuals with intent to help may of caused damage by expressing considerable opinions publicly rather than directly to Equifax representatives. Following figure that data breach disclosure to public may increase instability rather than ameliorate so sensitivity to public regarding data breach information must remain considered. &nbsp;</p>
