        Cyber-attacks create dramatic impact upon stability of stock markets nationally and internationally. Cyber-attacks are currently recognized per short term impacts as result of “opportunistic trading” – Important to scope of this paper is recognizing long term impact of actions resulting from generally considered short term opportunism. Recognition will be to better evaluate effective, comprehensive, justifiable response of and for data breach related cyber security. Achieving expressed recognition is possible by examining records of multiple research journals and news reports. Examination correlates recession events of companies experiencing cyber-attack related data breaches not only months prior event to damages years after event with potential of additional cyber-attack related opportunistic trading previously unrecognized. In short, results show a company and market suffer not only short-term impacts of data breach trading opportunism; the effects are also long term, though not only directly resultant of impact to product consumer or investor of data breached company. Evidenced of the long-term effect is investors developing platforms for seeking indemnification for themselves by a company for data breach and/or opportunistic trading events over an extensive timeframe of years. Yet less recognized is the contrast of damage to legal proceedings versus immediate impact of data breach. Unknown as of writing is whether data regarding data breaches and opportunistic trades occurring post initial data breach as result of indemnification action or prior indemnification periods is conducted by investors as stocks typically drop substantially within this time frame without corroborating data; potentially obfuscating initial research. Inquiry with increased depth of review regarding trade history correlating impact of data breach periods relative to initial catalyst could most likely amplify elaboration and development of remediations suggestions here within. Remediation intends to be akin holistic healthcare: preventative and reactive, though these identities are not exclusionary of one another, certain granularity of understanding determines nuance for recommending prior approach pre the latter. Approach within intends recognition for reduction of market instability. Statistical monitoring algorithms coupled with bureaucratic oversight adjustment could intrinsically ameliorate integrity of companies reducing susceptibility to opportunistic trades both pre and post initial data breach or opportunism catalyst resulting in and resultant of indemnifying action. Exploring preventative and reactive options may intertwine and diverge at points involving discussion such as artificial intelligence and proceedings related to SEC bureaucratic actionability. Bureaucratic response such as freezing a company stock in market is a possible prevention, additionally a reaction as the prevention is to stop damage much like a cyber security professional might power off a device to stop a network attack. Reactive in how recognition occurs requires a reaction, as a means of patching perimeter defense opening, an opening generally best kept closed. Per this example, damage to a market stock is relatively speaking, network walls. Freezing is also a reaction as freezing could foreseeably be contingent upon a data stream, set, or live action. Examination and development of research herewith in will attempt to delineate granularity or nuance for such distinctions as process per suggestions of remediation.

        To better understand difficulties of addressing opportunistic trading consider publicly traded companies comprise one fiftieth of all opportunistic trading incidents. (Lin Sapp, Ulmer, Parsa) To this end, risk of trading publicly vs privately varies as publicly traded companies give annual, quarterly, seasonal, et al. reports to the public whereas privately held companies typically may not. (Open Shares Blog) Additionally, and perhaps intuitive relative to prior point is many rulings of SEC jurisdiction hold public and private companies to differing standards of accountability. (Tech Republic 2017) Per contrasting this identification, incidence of public vs private opportunistic trading information is not as readily available as publicly traded companies report more information. Impact of privately held company data breaches are generally contained further away from public purview. Reasoning of referenced research main tenet regarding opportunistic trading is examining public company data to evaluate how public company data reflects private company patterns. Examining public company data allows for qualifying impacts and creating paradigms. Paradigms for predicting private company investor trading patterns per public company investor trading patterns is then useful for developing parallels recognizing pre, post, and current market behaviors. Company example Equifax as discussed as case for recognizing disparity for time of breach to legal action is examined through various stock trading tools; models for patterning behavior were and are created to examine publicly and privately managed companies in tandem by applying pattern recognition for aforementioned parallels. Endeavor of investigating privately traded company parameters alongside data of publicly traded companies illuminates opportunities towards market stability ideation. Assessing private companies could increase stability as private company data breaches are more frequent than public company breaches. Effectively identifying parallels between public and private companies of opportunistic trades with public company information and evaluating motives for existence of these parallels is crucial for developing comprehensive operational chain transformation for increasing market stability.

        Elaborating impacts of data breaches ideation intends to be a holistic approach suggesting intent is most likely capable of shifting narrative away from punitive or criminalizing schemas as suggested by citation identifying correlations of position to increased opportunism. Is unclear that increased SEC punitive measures will ameliorate insider trading as researchers suggested. Many suffer for results of opportunistic trades as well as their causes. Unlike previous research, the gains from opportunistic trades are or can be short lived rather than long term gains as a company rebounds from decline. Both opportunistic trading and increased punitive measures could have negative results as fear can also increase instability. (News Desk 2018) “This has a damaging effect on the market’s integrity as a system, and taking this line of thought further, it can lead to many participants being driven away from it [stock exchange] altogether.” concerns not explored in depth here imply strong need for alternatives to punitive response towards rehabilitative response. Additionally, research gives reason to believe alternative means must be demonstrated as the long-term aggregate damage discovered herein is market instability; Though individual opportunistic traders may understand how to use stock market tools and resources, they however may not understand the implications of their actions at large as fear is generally a mechanism of self-preservation. Complicating market stability is better stemmed than allowed and complication may result by increasing punitive damages. Redirection from punitive action is not to argue against legal measures such as treble law, or other indemnifying action. Though such legal actions are potentially more destabilizing than damages such actions are response to; merit is recognized despite speculated risk. Primary idea is all spectrums of criminal or criminalized behavior roots causes could be: Identified, mitigated, decriminalized reducing suffering. Though an action may be considered abhorrent, destructive, unsupportive does not necessarily mean person should be persecuted so much as diagnosed and treated. Reduction of suffering is motivating this consideration and should be kept at forefront, even with indemnification measures applied. Showcasing need for alternative response is those who are caught conducting opportunistic trades often see less “savings” per their trade than if not conducting opportunistic trading, this if excluding exchanges such as put options. (Department of Justice) Put options as evidenced by Equifax former manager at face value seem greedy; like alternative choices for opportunistic trade stem from a general perception per many cases may be misguided. Misguided by trader acting with saving mentality implies more likely a fear component driving opportunism rather than a long-term aggregate or logical component. Additionally, members conducting these opportunistic trades may also be responsible for such trades being required of them as they may soon find themselves out of a job creating if statement of action. If potentially responsible for data breach due to incorrect action; then increase likelihood of opportunistic trading. A lack of logical reasoning then compounds to the market as signaling of their behavior can be monitored as well as those caught often incur fines far exceeding the value if not only negating the income of their opportunism. Given existent conditions are not stopping opportunistic trading as well as these conditions potentially increasing instability rather than decreasing suggest need for alternative response.

        Fortunately, alternative response can take many forms as previously mentioned. One such form is data analysis algorithm utilizing existing data to detect patterns of trading by sorting and cycling through trades of companies to predict opportunistic trades through evaluating market history and correlating with average or cyclical fluctuations. Data analysis algorithms could be calibrated to be both preventative and reactive: predictive algorithms preventing opportunistic trading and reactive algorithms responding to opportunistic trading trends after identified. Additionally, proposed systems could use data mining tools analyzing real-time stock trades compared against current data identifying outliers of stock trades not matching typical public company behaviors. Statistical data monitoring algorithms not only monitor impacts of opportunistic trading but could also conduct predictive analysis by correlating current and past data for statistical modeling. Quantitative analysis is more than theoretically possible; application is an exploratory endeavor for mitigating instability. Stock trading algorithms predicting stocks’ market performance provides visualizations for patterns allowing for algorithmic approaches to identifying opportunistic trading actions by visualizing potential future trades based on current data. Development of data analysis algorithms alongside statistical monitoring tools are essential steps toward understanding and reducing opportunistic trading by ensuring trading activities remain within recognized stability parameters, thereby contributing to market stability and resilience.
