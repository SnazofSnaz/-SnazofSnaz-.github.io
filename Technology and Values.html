Technology shapes the world today through calculated ways to a largely incalculable extent. Calculated is development of the internet &ndash; a networking of computers allowing sharing of information. This networking is calculable solely to the extent that input corresponds to expected output. Networking of individual systems then expanded to what is known today colloquially as the internet, really refers to the World Wide Web or WWW. Incalculable are the numerous developments resultant from &ldquo;the web&rdquo; developing. Currently is believed about fifty percent of the global population has access to and/or uses the internet daily. Fifty percent of people able to exhaustively: research, communicate, and share! None of this would be if not for mathematics. Mathematics developed with tools like an abacus; for calculating, are the beginnings of what would be &ldquo;the web&rdquo; today. Building upon inventions of the past were people such as Charles Babbage. Charles Babbage developed mechanical computers with intentions like an abacus. Babbage&rsquo;s abacus was namely a difference engine and an analytical engine for solving equations. These were not engines thought of today generating propulsion for cars. These engines were locomotives of mathematics, generating calculations like an abacus provided at faster rate. This faster rate most understood by comparing a car or a difference engine to that of a cart pulled by&nbsp;</span></p>

Improvements of Babbage are relevant only when recognizing what Babbage&rsquo;s improvements relate to. Computing is necessary as all internet and world wide web is computation based. Computations of data are what allow information to be seen and displayed. Displays are often demarked with a one or zero; known as binary notation. Data, all data: Documents typed with word are stored and quickly accessible because of computation. Understanding data&rsquo;s facets allows understanding operations of the world wide web. Much like a word document. the world wide web is documents of varying types and specificity. Improvements such as Babbage&rsquo;s are necessary relative to scale. Exemplary of need for scaling improvements is Herman Hollerith&rsquo;s Desk. Scale is primary to understand innovation of &ldquo;the web&rdquo; as the web is symbolic of human growth much like the television. Television was able to connect people of vastly different locales to see: media, movies, experiences much like the web today. This parallel most demonstrable through online distributors such as Netflix. Herman Hollerith&rsquo;s machine acted with interests of allowing seeing similarly like a television; distinction being a seeking for vast amounts of data input per its output rather than output of less measured input such as television offered. Explicitly Hollerith&rsquo;s Desk invented during the 1800&rsquo;s was to manage or observe population growth known as census accounting. This required much more speed as prior to this invention the United States Census required two years to tabulate. Hollerith&rsquo;s Desk was such an improvement that the census of the 1880&rsquo;s was completed within six weeks. When thinking of the World Wide Web is better to think of it as a hybrid of input and output, unlike television, WWW is more often immediately interactive. This historical breakthrough of computation parallels changes today. Today computers operate with millions of instructions per second, rendering web page documents for visualizing via graphical user interfaces; also known as monitors. This millions of instructions&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;per second, is accelerating to billions of instructions per second. With more instructions are more solutions, processes, and scalability. When thinking of the WWW is important to recognize these developments are all resultant of scale. More photos are being shared, music being made, data being generated demanding collection for dissemination. Instructions of a computer are much how instructions are for a person. Instructions denote where to render each image&rsquo;s: color, size, animation, everything! Though computers are capable of cooperative gestures, computers are also capable of obfuscation. Much of Morse code or encryption relies on a series of computations determining relative linguistic identifiers. Though Morse code like the abacus is decipherable by simplified or brief tabulations; computers compound such signals with complexity, or obfuscation. During World War II the British developed a computational machine to break such encryption of German armies. This breaking of encryption allowed precise understanding of communications aiding militaristic advantage. Through these developments the power of computers becomes more apparent. This power&rsquo;s connection is not often understood relative to the World Wide Web. The same power of war and demography is what enables vast amounts of sharing today. Every encrypted phrase of German military is comparably and similarly rendered with the same processing power as every web page document. Similarity is that every letter whatever featured language requires data to remain render able. This has seen development as computations became more pluralism driven. This pluralism being an expansion to include accented characters, foreign symbols, various stylings took form through Unicode. Unicode successor of ASCI allows for fundamental inclusions of letterings. ASCI like UNICODE are rules of language like MLA formatting allows computers utilizing those languages to process one set of data similarly. Say a person attempted to type a Japanese character with ASCI &ndash; due to limitations of ASCI that character would never render. UNICODE is a far larger set of instructions for data allowing for Japanese characters to render. Imagine Letters of data are then&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;stored through series of numbers corresponding to pre-set symbols also known as characters. 1 equating to capital A 2 for capital B. This idea of scale is recurrent, technology, WWW, is all resultant of scale. These developments are emblematic of growing need for technology, to share through effective communication. Growing need evident through UNICODE extending character accessibility of ASCI&rsquo;s 256 characters to UNICODE&rsquo;s 65,000 characters. Assigning data to numeric lists and rendering those numeric lists to a reader requires great processing. This expansion allowing for more than just English lettering systems. The means of technology becomes evident and necessary though the outcome is reliant foremost upon the user. What will people write and share? Why will people share and what will that mean for future generations? Technology cannot answer all these questions but, technology will be means for such answers.&nbsp;</span></p>
