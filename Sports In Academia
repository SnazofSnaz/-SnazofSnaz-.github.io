<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'>The impacts of collegiate athletics spending yield disproportionate negative results upon non athletic students. Often collegiate athletics are cited to be: Strengthening of community and/or camaraderie, benefitting perceived school status, developing individual character. Unfortunately opposed to plethora of descriptive sugar coating regarding collegiate athletics is a bitterness of muted taste to most palettes. This bitterness being: Collegiate athletic subsidies, divisive school politics, misrepresentation and/or disenfranchisement of value from producers, and racial stratifications paralleling. These realities underwrite the smiling faces of collegiate athletics point of sales, like a sales tag posted onto an item after markup. Many scholarships within athletics represent a similar sale. Dissimilarity of this sales parallel is that states and non-athletics students generally front for bills not paid by athletic endowments usually through student loans. Writing of money is concerning seeing as bottom line of higher education&rsquo;s spending increase regarding athletics is more than scholastic spending increases. Troublesome is rate of student debt increasing showcases corresponding data relative to athletics spending increasing. Directing more attention towards recognizing facets and conditions determining student debt is imperative for determining longevity of academia&rsquo;s current business model.</p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding discrepancies of expense for students per misrepresentation of value is best understood by the NCAA data itself. &ldquo;NCAA data show that only 16.2 percent of the spending at Division 1 schools with football, such as Miami, goes to student aid. The rest goes to salaries, game expenses and facilities.&rdquo; (USA TODAY). To reiterate, less than a fifth of all spending at the most prestigious sustainable business model of college athletics goes to aid student academics. These sustainable business models are as such due to television promotions, advertising etc. For unsustainable variations, the numbers are not nearly as &ldquo;generous.&rdquo; Compounding these concerns is of millions of dollars generated by students through these colleges is unlikely available to students for their performance. Disenfranchisement such as this while potentially affording costs for production of revenue through tuition payments not institutionally funded. Is evident this business model bears down upon its constituents to thrive. College athletics, comparable to an arms race relative to competing colleges is cited as having a primary casualty. Primary casualty of colleges is generally considered academics and student services. This casualty causality is evidenced via data suggesting campuses with football athletics spent seven times more on athletes than non-athletes. Without football that number reduced to nearly two and a half times as much. This discrepancy with consideration of academia&rsquo;s primary function to educate mentally rather than strengthen physically, opposite the intent of a gym, is dubious. Justifications for non-athletic students footing expenses such as these are questionable at best. Understanding college athletics means understanding a badly run business. Understanding a badly run business is knowing where money is lost. A business is struggling when a business does not afford expenses. Collegiate athletics oftentimes is struggling due to subsidization of expenses through credit of unknowing and/or unwitting payers such as their student body.</p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.25in;'>Divisive school politics are prominent and very closely tied to misrepresentation of values. Divisive school politics not immediately demonstrable by nature of subsidization is demonstrable by nature of validating failed business enterprises such as collegiate athletics.</p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>Insidiously, colleges cite athletics as their mouthpiece to community. The draw of stating collegiate athletics brought together an amount of four thousand people into one sitting considered worthwhile for the price incurred by entire student body. The harmful condition is most college student bodies are comprised of more than four thousand students. Noting this disproportionate representation then benefit of athletics justification is questionable. Sickly if not comically if not ironic is the nature of how capitalism diverges from such sentiments however, college athletics makes claim such business practice are justifiable. Inherent nature of such comments is divisive because such comments do not consider students not attending these sports events. Arguments such as these are divisive as they also do not consider expenses of students not benefitting from collegiate athletics. Justification of cost without transparent consent of student body is divisive as it promulgates attitudes of entitlement without speaking directly of entitlement. Entitlement being that though students attending academia for non-superfluous activity such as athletics, should allow excessive fiscal disadvantage for price of admission. Attitudes of entitlement being the nature of relating to different students such as expenses paid or financial investment by academia to athletes rather than engineers. Though not all schools are cut of the same cloth fiscally, the overarching principle worth comment here is little data justifies claims to justify such debt excess. Though these arguments exist within fields such as art, few art students face the costs athletes incur. Surveys show that nearly seventy percent of students at surveyed colleges were indifferent to their sports team yet, such surreptitious divisive elements remain. Unfortunately, subtle distinctions such as these showcase collegiate athletics more akin to parasite than the oft cited yet infrequently realized positive representation of symbiote.</p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.25in;'>Parasitism or ponzi scheme developments are notable through anti-trust lawsuit filed against NCAA. Aside from anti-trust cases are personal accounts such as Mccormicks remembering &ldquo;College sports [are] a multi-billion-dollar business, and here was a top talent stuck with a dilapidated two-wheel.&rdquo; Through this recognition is not enough to look at a college itself, one must look at the overarching governances of all colleges for sports competition, The National Collegiate Athletic Association. The NCAA began to address the dangerous nature of football in the early twentieth century with Roosevelt. Today, the NCAA is &ldquo;arguably one of the most controversial tax-exempt organizations in existence (the association accrued $814 million in revenue in 2011)&rdquo; (Huffington Post). Touted as protecting students from &ldquo;dangerous and exploitive athletics practice of the time.&rdquo;(Huffington Post). Today however, the NCAA is primely positioned to gain the most from those this organization claims to be positioned to protect. Disparities of rationale and integrity are broad beginning with disallowing positive sentimental display of sports jerseys for camaraderie to inability of NCAA conducting transparent investigation of a financial base. Clear is the NCAA interest towards keeping its proverbial money engine running while allowing weakening of its surrounding system. This takes many forms though whether they are deliberately or inadvertent depends at where one begins examining history of the NCAA. Contemporary NCAA hints at signs of systemic racism.</p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I saw a small group of black faces in the stands, and they were [football] recruits, it was incredible. I realized all of the people being paid or getting the pleasure out of the game were white, and the vast majority of the people playing and risking their health were black.&rdquo; (Vice). Compounded with elements of disenfranchisement generally not sorted by race is a racial component. Typically, most collegiate revenue generating sports athletes such as football are represented primarily by people of African American descent. Staggering with this consideration is disproportionate wealth distribution where African American players within context of colleges are restricted unlike pro NFL players who have unionized. Collegiate athletes receive about ten percent of total revenue, primarily as scholarships that are subsidized in part by entire student body. NFL players, also primarily African American, negotiated to receive approximately fifty percent of revenue generated. Originally rules of amateurism prevalent within NCAA guidelines were classist, to create a system where aristocrats would not need compete or involve themselves with brick layers. Unfortunately, underpinnings of wealth discrimination are now identified through racial signifiers. This burgeoning development was not initially a concern to classists inception of NCAA given the nature of segregation however, times have changed unlike the basis of NCAA.</p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Reviewing multitudes of conditions related to NCAA as well as subsidiary collegiate athletics an evident damage is inflicted onto communities NCAA touts itself as protector and representative of. Whether damage be visible or invisible to onlooker does not change ramifications of damage. From disenfranchising constituent athletes whether formally or diagnostically, NCAA is taking on much more money than it returns to its affiliates at the expense of its affiliates whom NCAA organized to protect and serve the interests of. This being of such an enterprise is divisive. Divisive like an engine of a rental car with an oil leak. This engine will continue to operate though leak persists, however, over time this engine will fail after being drained of its core lubricant. Though by the time such a rental is returned, the owner&rsquo;s will bear the burden for lapse of maintenance.</p>
