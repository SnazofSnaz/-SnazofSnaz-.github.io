<h1>Film Analysis Project</h1>

<div class="paragraph">
    <strong>Film title:</strong> No Logo Brands, Globalization, Resistance<br>
    <strong>Year of release:</strong> 2003<br>
    <strong>Studio:</strong> Media Education Foundation<br>
    <strong>Director:</strong> Sut Jhally with Naomi Klein<br>
    <strong>Composer(s):</strong> Thom Monahan
</div>

<div class="section-title">2. Why did you select this film?</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    I selected this film as I'd read the book <em>No Logo</em> many years ago. I found Naomi Klein's narrative of branding and globalization very insightful and inspiring. I selected this film as I'd been browsing Kanopy to choose what film and saw this. The idea of adbusting and critically engaging narratives felt and feels greatly informative. At first, I felt reluctant because it is more a documentary, however, <em>No Logo</em> utilizes sound for its narrative just as other films would, thus I approach this as I would another film to see how music affects this documentarial narrative.
</div>

<div class="section-title">3. Briefly summarize the biography of the composer of this film score.</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    Thom Monahan is a musician turned music producer, notable within the "indie" music scene with works alongside artists such as Devendra Banhart, Modest Mouse, and Peter Bjorn and John. Monahan began his musical career playing as a bassist with several bands before becoming a music producer or "mixer" with artists among the indie scene.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    As a kid, Monahan enjoyed recording "strange noises" and spent a great deal of time with sound recording and amplification equipment. Learning to build such equipment to the point of dismantling boomboxes, Monahan moved to Massachusetts. In Massachusetts, Monahan recorded his first record with a band, and after being signed by Sub Pop Records, the rest is history.
</div>

<div class="section-title">4. Briefly summarize the plot of the film and create a character arc for the main character(s).</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    The plot of this documentary is an expose on the psychology regarding the nature of branding and its impact on consumers. It highlights how the trade of ideas has taken precedence over physical goods, affecting the value of producers. Given this is a documentary, the main character can be you, the viewer, or the narrator/researcher Naomi Klein. Arguably, everyone is a main character in this story as it involves all participants of consumer marketplaces.
</div>

<div class="section-title">5. How are social problems addressed in this film?</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    This film aims to create awareness regarding the globalization of marketplaces relative to corporate ownership. It emphasizes that supporting corporations over individuals doesn't necessarily support people. The documentary describes this phenomenon as a "race to the bottom" for working people, highlighting how corporations end up devaluing the producers of the products. It aims to change the intellectual landscape to better inform consumers within a global marketplace.

    The music in this film complements its narrative by directing attention to critical points, whether celebrating or criticizing brands. Through contrasting sounds, the music emphasizes key moments and underscores the duality in the film's argument about branding.
