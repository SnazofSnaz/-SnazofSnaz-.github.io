<p>2. Why did you select this film?</p>

<p>I selected this film as I'd read the book No Logo many years ago. I found Naomi Klein's narrative of branding and globalization very insightful and inspiring. I selected this film as I'd been browsing Kanopy to choose what film and saw this. The idea of adbusting and critically engaging narratives felt and feels greatly informative. At first I felt reluctant because it is more a documentary however, No Logo utilizes sound for its narrative just as other films would thus, I approach this as I would another film to see how music affects this documentarial narrative.</p>

<p>3. Briefly summarize the biography of the composer of this film score. </p>

<p>Thom Monahan is a musician turned music producer. Notable within &quot;indie&quot; music scene with works alongside artists such as Devendra Banhart, Modest Mouse, Peter Bjorn and John. Monahan began his musical career playing as a bassist with several bands before becoming a music producer or &quot;mixer&quot; with artists among the indie scene.</p>

<p>As a kid Monahan enjoyed recording &quot;strange noises&quot; (Thom Monahan) and spent a great deal of time with sound recording &amp; amplification equipment. Learning to build such equipment to the point of dismantling boomboxes, Monahan moved to Massachusetts. In Massachusetts Monahan recorded their first record with a band, after being signed by Sub Pop Records the rest is history.</p>

4. Briefly summarize the plot of the film and create a character arc for the main character(s).</p>

<p>The plot of this documentary is very much an expose of psychology regarding the nature of branding and the impact of such branding upon consumers. How the trade of ideas has taken precedence/priority over physical goods, invariably also the valuation of producers of goods lacking precedence with such regards. How creating contrast between advertised and non-advertised spaces can create the identity of monopoly through contrast. Given this is a documentary, the main character can be: You or I, the viewer, with their experience; the narrator/researcher Naomi Klein with their explanation, or the individuals portrayed, as they too are viewers as much as they are viewed within the context of globalization. Arguably, everyone is a main character to this story as it involves everyone who is a participant and by extension of the concept of duality non-participant of consumer marketplaces.</p>

<p>5. How are social problems addressed in this film? </p>

<p>This film aims to create awareness regarding globalization of marketplaces relative to corporate ownership. Awareness that the belief of supporting corporations instead of individuals will in turn not support people as opposed to claims that supporting corporations would support people. Overwhelmingly this documentary describes this phenomenon as a possible &quot;race to the bottom&quot; for working people by showing how corporations invariably end up not supporting the producers of the products corporate ideas are based upon. Instead the ideas become more valued than the commodity itself, relegating the product secondary to the idea, invariably relegating the producer of the commodity to be less valued as well. This documentary aims to address this issue, in terms of changing the intellectual landscape to recognize such &quot;tricks of light&quot; to better empower through informing consumers within a global marketplace.</p>

9. How does music complement the narrative of the film? </p>

<p>This music complements this film narrative by amplifying or more aptly directing a sense of what is being discussed whether it be Celebration, Florida with soft songs, or power co-option by brands such as Tommy Hilfiger with distortion. Throughout this narrative of globalization this music draws increased attention towards identifying critical points through use of dynamics. Whether critical points be interpreting advertising strategy of brands such as: cars or clothes et al. or entire housing developments. Discussing contrasts is the center of this film and this music is representative of such contrast per its employ at moments of stress, and lack of stress, where lack of ads becomes an ad itself; a softer music is played. This dichotomy of sound through distinctive textures adds greater emphasis to the distortive music precluding response of ad-less space vs advertised space. This music emphasizes duality or the &quot;two sides of one coin&quot; that this argument of branding encapsulates by virtue of its dissonance through stark contrast. </p>
