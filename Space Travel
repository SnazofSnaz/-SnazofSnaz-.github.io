When discussing such current events is important to reference Elon Musk &quot;He called the venture a &ldquo;giant insurance policy&quot;&quot;(Howe 8). Why exactly is this believed, and could the resources put towards space travel be better utilized for maintaining the habitability of Earth? Often, the idea that Space Flight is for the betterment of humanity is a primary selling point, and this could be however, is important to recognize that such beliefs are a response to factors making life of Earth seem dismal rather than probable. Similar to other plights of humanity: Artists during times of stress have often made new art genres as response to climates of the time. Plausibly, space flight is a similar response paralleling artistry; one of flight versus one of varying non flight craft media. Art groups such as Russian Futurism responding to the effects of Cold War dystopia could be compared to Space FlightX as response to political, and economic strife. Additionally, the idea that space flight benefits the human population is contradictory though Howe would point out experts of the day preceeding space flight &quot;were certain that flight, however interesting, was destined to be not much more than a rich man&apos;s hobby with no practical value&quot; (5). This pointing to naysayers of bygone era as contradiction is dubious belies that flight really is also a matter of access, space or otherwise. Current geo-political climate still suggests not everyone can afford to use a plane so, to best make such point one should qualify rich - what is rich? Though American wants to build a wall to stop people from entering this country! Yes fifty or so percent of Mexican people enter through flights! That does not change that fifty percent cannot or do not. What is lacking from such discussion is not that this helps everyone but, who is left behind as a result? To preface that space flight is virtuous or noble on account of insurance policy for humanity while diverting resources from humanity to afford such venture, is dubious though fanciful. Is acceptable to agree with space flight as valid enterprise but, remain very clear about why, and what will be accomplished. Unfortunately, this argument premise does not necessarily aid all of humanity as Howe would argue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>Redacted from this argument is knowledge that planes generate more Co2 than trains for travel, and benefit of flight is rapidity. The benefit of flight is not extended to all as notable by American politics is now required a certain registration of citizenship to access flight. A train is limited to where may travel and takes far longer to reach a destination though is accessible by more people. This argument claims benefit to all however, while doing so ignores qualifying factors for who benefits as an attempt to push agenda of funneling money towards people and person&rsquo;s who would be able to accept such insurance policies. This argument does not mention that many Americans do not have insurance let alone people globally having healthcare at all. Perhaps if space flight advancement focused more attention towards the research generated benefitting Earth bound person(s) then Howe would of made a stronger argument. Unfortunately, that argument is not cased, nor is argument about where money for space flight is generated being discussed. Again, unfortunately, if you&rsquo;ve ever used a &ldquo;250$ desktop&rdquo; (8) as Howe describes, you would know they aren&rsquo;t very fast like a plane is. You would also know with a little history that much funding for such &ldquo;fanciful&rdquo; technologies were built through government funding during a time of civil rights unrest. With a little research you would know that only fifty percent of people have regular access to the internet. The argument Howe is making is a dangerously shallow one. Is ill advised to believe such fanciful rhetoric like Howe&rsquo;s thanking of one percenters is laughably similar to trickle down economics where reduced taxes do not amount to increased investment towards economies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>Space flight, at least from this point of view, is one benefitting very few.&rdquo;</span><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s possible that tomorrow&rsquo;s budget minded space travelers will thank today&rsquo;s 1-percenters, just as you can credit early adopters of expensive, behemoth mainframe computers for your $250 desktop&rdquo; (Howe 8). This more substantive version of quote to emphasize the importance of where one&rsquo;s attention be directed with regards to space flight. Initially universities developed computers to better share research with aid of government spending, individual tax dollars. Another point of Howe &ldquo;we spent all those billions of dollars to produce, among other things, magnificent and iconic remote photographs of Earth that fired the environmental movement to focus on protecting our lonely, beautiful, fragile blue island of a planet&rdquo; (9). This is preposterous as those billions of dollars were spent for a war effort to create a mass retaliation effort to the potential impacts of Cold War politics. This framing of Earth as lonely and little is dubious as it intends to push space flight as creating a less lonely Earth. The environmental movement existed long before space flight and at times has communicated against space flight as debris from space shuttles lands across America with every launch. Co2 emissions are a threat and for a time space flight was considered damaging of the Earth&rsquo;s stratosphere. Unfortunately, no discourse regarding space flight can be sufficiently justified unless the returns of such apply to the land supporting such endeavor. Taxpayers support space flight and are to thank for desktop computers, that not all can afford. Taxpayers are the people working and purchasing products that allow billionaires to be billionaires.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>Unfortunately, the red herring fallacy of who to thank and the benefits of space flight have fallen flat to the truth recorded by history regardless of Howe&rsquo;s revisionist storytelling. Like the space flight explosions of the sky scarring landscapes of Earth and human psyche. No distraction will be enough to deter people from recognizing that unless space flight showcases benefit for all then it be for the benefit of few. Omitting core details of who can afford flight or computers, and distractions of who to thank and false grounds for previously stated benefits showcase space flight is not for all as is for few. So, if nothing else Howe was right about one factor that space flight is like an insurance policy for the human population. Unfortunately, not everyone is insured. Howe should take careful consideration of space flight&rsquo;s impacting those people before portending this is for the benefit of the human population as such descriptor aims to present. All this less the hidden assumption be that Howe believe every person can afford a 250$ computer, which with only a little research would show that&rsquo;s not true.</span></p>
