<p style='margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'><span style="color:#2D3B45;background:white;">What is punishment? Such a question may sound silly as this word allows memories, or stories from a vast spectrum of personal and impersonal experience. Though one must explore the concept of punishment to understand how vast this spectrum truly truly is. Punishment&rsquo;s vastness is primarily due to a broad range of implications relative to the conditions leading to punishment&rsquo;s being. Looking at definitions of punishment will showcase the extent to which one can explore possible ramifications of punishment. Punishment is defined as &ldquo;the infliction or imposition of a penalty as retribution.&rdquo; (Websters) Punishment is also known as &ldquo;rough treatment or handling inflicted on or suffered by a person or thing.&rdquo; (Websters) This contrast of meaning is worthy of pause. To truly understand punishment is to define retribution - or at very least recognize variations of what retribution means exist. With distinct definitions is clear punishment exists as inflicted for a wrong or criminal act and rough treatment removed of condition. This removal of condition is a primary concern regarding punishment. Removal of reason for punishment or punishment not thoroughly defined is cause of staggering potential for abuse. Unfortunately abuse, like punishment, has many definitions. One definition of punishment &nbsp;being to use something to bad effect or for a bad purpose. Reckoning this understanding is then possible to assert punishment devoid of clear definition is very likely a pathway to abuse. Duly, this view is because definitions of punishment and abuse share a commonality though this commonality not made glaringly apparent or recognized. Furthermore this commonality of punishment and abuse is very near being synonymous though context of reference is usually disparate or dissociated. Understanding punishment means understanding the causes of punishment and conditions leading to punishment so as to better alleviate if not remove criteria, cause, and/or symptoms of abuse resultant of oversight and unclear determinations of punishment.</span></p>
<p style='margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="color:#2D3B45;background:white;">A firm example of abuse,for those who do not support enslavement is punishment being condition allowing slavery. The United States of America constitution thirteenth amendment allows slavery as condition of punishment only if conviction through court system occurs. Indicative then is a need for strong and clear definitions of punishment. Given definitions of punishment coupled with America&rsquo;s chronic issue of civil rights; should immediately be clear the implications of unclear definitions of punishment, particularly implications of punishment&rsquo;s defining. If punishment has limited boundaries relative to changing circumstances determined by culture then definition and qualifiers of punishment are intrinsic of culture. Dissatisfying then is to recognize the damnable implications of such definitions. Exacerbating this point of broad implications regarding punishment is who can determine what is and is not rough treatment. Furthermore, what bearings define what is a wrong or criminal action allowing considerations such as enslavement a fitting response? Resulting from such implications is push towards refining if not distinguishing punishment. Distinctions of genuine compassionate punishment to replace vengeful, thoughtless, or corrupt punishment. Such persons exemplary of this renaissance of punishment are Clayton Ruby who states &ldquo;Anyone who can hire a good psychiatrist and a good lawyer will never be executed. Is it fair to take the lives of those who are poor because they are poor?&rdquo; (Toronto Star) This simple yet exemplary statement showcases nuance to punishment regarding the exacting of punishment. Frighteningly the nuance of punishment&rsquo;s exacting is characterized by or lack of access to professional external opinions of merit such as how edification often warrants mitigation of suffering. Through this understand suffering as equating &nbsp;to punishment and understand punishment relative to the punished may not necessarily be intrinsic as is circumstantial. By extension then is clear that punishment is relative to conditions surrounding punishment thus, grappling with punishment is to grapple with conceptualization if not understanding(s) regarding punishment. Through this understanding is possible to see why defining punishment and punishment&rsquo;s desired result clearly is imperative. Without clear definition the potential of abuse is as boundless as cultural climate allows. Privilege of mitigating punishment should be expanded to those without access as is to those with.</span></p>
<p style='margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="color:#2D3B45;background:white;">Contrarily though true to principles of vastness punishment is a double-edged sword due for implications of its doling. Exemplary of such double edge is increasing taxes for opiates to stem a rising tide of opiate addiction threatening primarily though not exclusively, rural America. This taxation for pursuit of lowering addiction statistics &nbsp;runs the risk of negatively impacting people who require medications. Resultant of such pursuit utilizing punishment takes on a form more desirable thought not fully form of compassionate punishment. Redeemingly compassionate for attempting to dissuade usage of a drug such as opium from impairing or hindering individuals autonomy. Unfortunately this does not fulfill desired goal as such taxation punishes those who use opiates to survive life threatening, physical, chronic illnesses via cost increase of preventative or quality of life health care. Additionally, relative to perception for a person addicted to opiates such taxation may also be considered a cruel punishment. Evidentiary is difficult then assessing whether such aims even with loftiest goals are proper remedy for perceived affliction of addiction. Unlike nicotine tax that inevitably decreases consumption; a baseline of opiate consumers will be essentially punished though inadvertently. Such duality of reasoning and exercising of constraints showcases the depth of thought required to fully realize why defining punishment and conditions allowing punishment are important. &nbsp;Additionally, defining intent of action such as taxation is important. Pointedly definition should be of utmost precedence regarding conceptualizing punishment rather than being an afterthought. An clear contrast to afterthought is visible by observing &ldquo;The legislature should insist that the dollars support recovery and treatment efforts.&rdquo; (City And State NY 24) Relative to opiate addiction if not more contexts of punishment is this should be the reason for taxation not the result. A common practice with punishment as recognized by David Garland is &ldquo;mistaking unintentional consequences as intentional.&rdquo; (Garland 402) This saying in so much that though there is tax money from such actions or punishments does not mean the intention was to support person&rsquo;s signaled as addicts as perhaps a means of collecting revenue from marginalized people. Though the tax would act to deter consumption does not go so far as to say that tax money will then go towards recovery programs. The only way to know that these are the intentions are to start dialogues regarding punishment having clear definitions of purpose for punishment and clear aims of how punishment may support cause for ending punishment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="color:#2D3B45;background:white;">Correlating to ending punishment is an introspection through Liz Truss where defining punishment takes center stage. This defining of punishment takes place regarding prisons and in a round about way what is colloquially known as the Prison Industrial Complex. The Prison Industrial Complex or (PIC) for short is known for a multitude of injustices related to minor offense to a revolving door or slave like existence for some. This practice of cyclical punishment takes form through privatization of prisons as sources of monetization through government payroll such as cheap labor harvesting gutting tilapia or sewing little league uniforms. Contrasted to such realities is Liz Truss introducing a bill questioning this exact nature of prisons, inherently the intent of prisons. Beseeching common sense are questions regarding whether the intent of prisons are to punish persons so that imprisoned person become considered incapable of changing or rising above the circumstances bringing them to prison. If the answer is no then one would consider a bill such as Truss proposes defining punishment as removal of liberty via imprisonment a good idea. If this former statement is true then, prison being a place for skill development and rehabilitation a clear cut voting choice. Though previously mentioned skills such as sewing and gutting tilapia could be useful they are not sufficient for removing oneself from such system completely. This is exactly the argument being made by Liz Truss however, the nature of punishment being so divisive and person&rsquo;s being so outraged allows vengeance and loss of reason to take forefront to recognizing and alleviating conditions leading to conditions deemed requiring punishment. One must be careful with hidden assumptions surrounding punishment to recognize that every statement is explored to find the complete meaning or weight of its deliberation. Though can be difficult or tenuous is of utmost importance to assert the grounds for how self-improvement or rehabilitation take place in forums such as imprisonment. &ldquo;Getting offenders into training and jobs when they leave prison so crime and misery to society is reduced.&rdquo; (The Telegraph) &nbsp;is of utmost importance.</span></p>
<p style='margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="color:#2D3B45;background:white;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Oftentimes acceptable punishment is not so clear thus rules are changed to mitigate need for future punishment as to stop repetition of suffering or future punishment. Such a case is demonstrated by the case of Roberta G. Devries and Shirley McAfee who are widows of navy sailors exposed to asbestos. This sadness as a result of a production line not being transparent regarding boat part manufacture to all involved with production. For this case punishment is relegated to develop definition lawfully allowing reduction for future punishment. Unlike prison industrial complexes where vengeance is inflicted upon individuals, a corporation pays a different price for vengeance in the form of capital, if not dissolution through bankruptcy. Through this case is witnessable the extent to which punishment is outlined though the impact of punishment varies due to the parties involved. Like formerly mentioned Clayton Ruby stated where access determines severity of punishment the same can be said of corporate institutions. Aside from this concurrence what is important to recognize regarding this case is decision by majority vote also known as group consensus. Importance of consensus is an illustration of determination being largely community based punishment is. In this instance a community of community appointed judges decides what is and what is not fair, whether that be a community of supreme court justices or a community of the people becomes anecdotal to the primacy of this fact. Crass yet exceptionally descriptive is primacy as such occurrences display matter of fact distinction exemplifying development or evolution of punishment. Effectively punishment develops through consensus of people over time.. Important to note is punishment is also perceptual as for some what may be a punishment is a boon and vice versa. Whether punishment be judicious or judgemental is often about what side a fence a person stands on regarding attention of judging. The take away from this case however, is that regardless of details a consensus decision must be made with follow up action. Action can take many forms though the form is often relative to the context of what incites need for punishment. Resounding quandry relating to punishment paralleled with by this case is mentions of punishment regarding responsibility and accountability in how a &ldquo;manufacturer has no reason to believe that the product&rsquo;s users would be aware of that danger.&rdquo; (Corp. V. Devries) Is responsibility of those involved with punishment to make clear the dangers and implications of their punishments? Is this not speaking to the imperative nature of defining punishment as making clear the dangers of punishment as punishers ought to? Such observations should not fall of attending to what Clayton suggested that access denies mitigation of punishment. Like prisoner industrial complex facilitators are manufacturers of punishment akin to those metal shop business owners as manufacturers of parts that may later include components causing health risks. The connection may seem disparate however, is not so distant a thought that responsibility for the entire manufacture whether a vehicular component or conceptualization of punishment both should be held equally responsible though often stronger claim be made for material concerns than abstract or conceptual. This however falls short of the constitution where excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. &nbsp;Is evident through consensus that this amendment has vastly different implications with potentially disastrous consequences.</span></p>
<p style='margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="color:#2D3B45;background:white;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Some instances of punishment are not so clear and some are intentionally abusive rather than inadvertenly or circumstantially. Instance of such happening is &ldquo;Cola-nization&rdquo; a term coined by Olga Jbeili regarding coca-colas investment into marginalized poverty stricken Africa, India, Indo-China regions. This Cola-nization a play on colonization is the usurpation of water rights of sovereign entities to saturate a market with consumer good Coca Cola and subsidiaries such as bottled water. This consumer good taking the place of a natural resource via privatization enacts a form a punishment akin to abuse though without stating so much the warnings or implications of abuse. Expected by companies operating within the United States are certain though like punishment, varying form of acceptability to one&rsquo;s consumer base.. Though Coca Cola does not undersell the public utility of water in the United States commonly through its subsidiary Dasani, it has in fact done so in Africa causing African&rsquo;s to purchase soda as a substitute for water decreasing health of the overall population. This health risk is insidious as requires a small amount of knowledge regarding the breakdown of Coca-Cola in the body. Coca-Cola requires hydrogen to break down its composite so, &nbsp;as water is privatized and sugary beverages are sold dehydration an other health problems develop proportionally. Like punishment of America where disenfranchised often suffer greater harm due to lack of access so to do the populaces of entire counties if not countries due to lack of access relative to multinational business interest. &ldquo;Multinational business is increasingly hindering developing economies, and must be checked before they cause too much harm.&rdquo; (Mic) unlike punishment inflicted upon individuals for committing minor to heinous crimes the punishment of multinationals is not doled out onto the multinational punishing the consumers or punishees of its presence. Ironically though evidence showcases the disastrous impacts of such enterprises companies such as Coca-Cola are allowed to flourish while decimating local economies. This showcases a broad definition of punishment where again community sets the standard and defines the tone of what is and is not allowable or considered punishment or punishable. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="color:#2D3B45;background:white;">To conclude is best to understand the ramifications both small and large of punishment. The hidden assumptions of punishment such as committing a person to death. What is the hidden assumption of enacting of such reality? Is a death sentence saying that person is incapable of changing? If not declared otherwise does this not say that a person of such sentencing is then a result of actions independent of circumstances surrounding such action? What are the hidden assumptions of claiming one person is responsible for another&rsquo;s actions while omitting responsibility of the person performing action causing another to be punished? Is that saying the person being punished is the reason for the fault, denying shared responsibility? Though these questions are abstract, does not mean so much they are without basis as the premise of this document showcases. &nbsp;To better understand why this is and why this is allowed is to understand the basis for human cognition. People derive understanding from what is perceived not from what is and this perception determines what punishment will follow as a result of formal and in-formalized action(s). Whether punishment is codified as enslavement or a slap on the wrist is relative to the conditions surrounding such discernment. A prime example of punishment gone awry is the fight against homelessness in Boise Idaho. Boise Idaho enacted a policy of punishment for person sitting or lying on public sidewalks due to lack of available housing options. This was furthered towards a melting pot of religiosity noted by Skanner newspaper as &ldquo;A city cannot via threat of prosecution, coerce an individual to attend religion based treatment.&rdquo; (Skanner) This codifies punishment as a means of inflicting wound or forced conversion upon person&rsquo;s without addressing conditions causing punishment to be incurred. &nbsp;This was argued as punishing &ldquo;conduct that is unavoidable consequence of being homeless.&rdquo; Frankly it was referred to as cruel and unusual in violation of the eighth amendment. As referenced earlier is a common problem with punishment to confuse unintentional consequence as intentional. Conflating a need for religion with ending legal persecution is illogical towards that of logical fallacy though, relative to scope of punishment and perception of punishment is to some acceptable. Likewise is conceivable that people believe the unintended use of sidewalks as beds as intentional as a hidden assumption towards judgment of individuals being threatened with prosecution via punishment. Solutions to such conditions are varied as are the reasons for such conditions being. What does not change however is the cause for punishment requiring a clear precise reason to begin punishment including a solution for ending punishment. Every punishment must result with an exit from punishment else a cycle of punishing never end. Homeless people generally would not sleep on streets yet given no alternative what use is punishing such person&rsquo;s? To this end stating one may not sit or lie on a sidewalk is inconceivably improper as this does nothing to address the conditions leading to punishing person&rsquo;s for doing such. Such thinking showcases the need for thorough exploration of punishment for positive results avoiding if not ending cycles and systems of abuse.</span></p>
