<p style='margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'>The goals of many 20<sup>th</sup> century people were motivated by at least face value to improve quality of life for all American People. Though there were some antebellum persons hailing to better times of hierarchy or grandiose sensibilities; many committed to improving quality of life for all. Relatively, degrees of success regarding these aims can be considerably debated regarding not extent of improvements made so much as the equity of such improvement. Two eras of interest during this century are the Progressive Era and the New Deal Era. The Progressive Era was earmarked by widespread social activism and reform of politics due to an overall sense of political corruption or developmental infrastructure problems associated with modernization such as industrialization. Through the Progressive Era much was accomplished though with many missteps &ndash; though should be noted is akin to nature of a newborn learning to walk as is the attending of governance to new situations for new governors. Regardless, these steps showed much unrest was deemed needing catharsis during. Some catharsis being result of Upton Sinclair&rsquo;s muckraking of meatpacking industry regarding health and labor standards. La Follette discussing corruption about bribery during his time as a congressman he was &ldquo;<span style="color:black;background:white;">extremely critical of the behaviour of some of the party bosses</span><span style='font-size:14px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black;background:white;'>.&rdquo; (</span><span style="color:black;background:white;">Spartacus</span><span style='font-size:14px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black;background:white;'>) for</span> offering bribes to fix court cases and questioned monopolies of the time relative to such actions. Unfortunately, not all circumstances began being addressed preventatively. Events relating to worker safety such as the Shirtwaist fires causing death and dismay were often what invoked final change for this era when unheeded complaints relented to loss of life. These are just some examples of an era fraught with the tumult of promise inherent to uncertainty. Similarly, The New Deal Era was an Era of great interest. A brief example to perceive much of this era was President Roosevelt&rsquo;s presidency where no photographs feature him wheelchair bound for fear of causing a loss of confidence for a beleaguered time. &ldquo;he never wanted to be photographed in his wheelchair or appear infirm in any way, for fear that the public&rsquo;s sympathy would transform into concern over his physical ability to discharge the duties.&rdquo; (OpenStax 759) If to examine a time where shows of confidence were most important is symbolism rendered by acts such as this. During this time such ceremony continued with leg braces hidden under trousers to aid such public image. During this time Roosevelt was a prime proponent to allaying fears by in some instances discontinuing policies of the Gilded Age, a lead up to the Depression. This allaying was through &ldquo;fireside chats&rdquo; discussing the events for departing from the gold standard towards the silver standard regarding monetization and reduction of bank privileges with deposit funds as with the Glass-Steagall Act. &nbsp;Though much was improved some concerns of this era showcased are events like the bonus army march on Washington. Like many shows of confidence proof remains in the pudding and believing in change is not always enough. &nbsp; As if the Bonus Army had asked Roosevelt to stand upright too soon, without preparation of his legs via his specialized trousers, this army had asked the government to pay a fee ahead of schedule and saw kindly, yet dogged removal as a result. Needless to point out the event of such a rushed president essentially paralleled the result of the Bonus Army action. <u>Comparatively these eras were both difficult though is clear the Progressive Era was more successful as it directed its attention and actions directly to problems of the time to inspire confidence rather than to artificially inspire confidence while not diminishing reasons reducing root causes of confidence diminishment.&nbsp;</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'>A prime example relating to acts to develop confidence while not removing basis for unconfident populace is the act of destroying food to artificially inflate farm prices. Confidence generally results from good conscience policies so is only fitting &ldquo;critics saw it as the ultimate example of corrupt capitalism: a government destroying food, while its citizens were starving, in order to drive up prices.&rdquo; (OpenStax 767) coupled with events of the Bonus Army march this era just seems disastrously disconnected in spirit from intent. Appears as a result this era was plagued with the problems sought to be addressed by The Progressive Era but instead remained focus upon fiscal numerics rather than quality of life essentials. When examining these two events, Bonus Army removal and agricultural surplus destruction coupled with knowledge of inflationary pressures what becomes evident is this era was more so about economic control rather than quality of life improvement; a stark though not explicit contrast to the former Progressive Era. The Progressive Era meant so much more for accountability by focusing on reducing inefficiency, waste, and corruption. When considering that most subsidies of the New Deal for farmers went to Large Factory farms; would only seem notable that the biggest benefiters affording such loss of supply would be large farms. Benefitting most from incremental price increase would be those who could afford such loss with supply remaining for sale. Such actions of inefficiency would be in direct contradiction to the aims and actions of Progressive Era activists who actively rooted out such behavior. Appears The New Deal Era meagerly attempted such similar stance as the Progressive Era&rsquo;s. A major component of such assessment is how text cites New Deal policies &ldquo;put capital into ailing banks, [it] rescued homeowners and farmers from foreclosure and helped people keep their homes&rdquo; (OpenStax 771). Such distinctions when removed from framings in terms of economics showcases how people believed in the American financial system that was also positioned to of crippled them. This positioning representative of a mouse believing a snake has comfort to offer. Though Roosevelt initiated Glass Steagall to return good faith to the American financial system when considering actions of this time supported larger entities such as Corporations or large farms to small business and small farms appears contradiction is apparent. Though at face value deals of this time seemed intent to aid disenfranchised the methods of employ seem but always less likely to accomplish such effect.</p>
<p style='margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to implications of economic degeneration and narrow focus or channeling of economic development through banks rather than distributing excess farm supply as economic currency is Robert La Follette. &ldquo;Robert La Follette the son of a small farmer&hellip; Was successful in persuading the federal government to introduce much needed reforms.&rdquo; (Spartacus) Unfortunately relations, especially political relations are described as very dynamic. &ldquo;<span style="color:#222222;background:white;">initially [Follette] enjoyed warm relations with President Roosevelt, La Follette soured somewhat on the president after Roosevelt declined to support some progressive measures&rdquo; (Thelen 60-61). Given the characterization of Follette as being from a small farm, a proponent of antitrust laws regarding monopolies by mob bosses such as Rockefeller, and his desired accomplishment towards supporting railroad workers rights seems the Progressive Era that Follette most distinctly resembles as a Progressive Himself was far more successful as it suited the needs of American&rsquo;s &nbsp;more than Roosevelt&rsquo;s an by extension the New Deal Era symbolized through their relation. Additionally, given the nature of Roosevelt&rsquo;s criticism inefficiency regarding destruction of surplus farm supply while utilizing banks was Follette arguing panic was induced by banks, particularly large corporations. Follette&rsquo;s positing a relationship of panic as means of orchestrating economic benefit to large corporations is not unknown to La Follette and paralleled contemporarily as is notable by Naomi Klein&rsquo;s <em>Shock Doctrine</em> regarding survivors of Hurricane Katrina. This shock, or panic as referred to by Follette relative to actions of Roosevelt causes a sense that not is all what it seems an should be of concern. Echoes of Follette&rsquo;s relationship to Roosevelt can be seen today as well where banks contest though unsuccessfully the same practices that plagued this era, an era that both Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt seemed to work closely with rather than distantly. Though in 1902 &ldquo;Roosevelt launched his administration&rsquo;s first antitrust suit against Northern Securities Trust Company which included powerful businessmen, like John D. Rockefeller and J. P. Morgan.&rdquo; (OpenStax 620) Theodore Roosevelt also made an agenda &ldquo;to eliminate business trusts&rdquo; does not mean forms of such behavior did not resurface through a different means then or later with Franklin Roosevelt&rsquo;s actions. Success, for purposes of this discussion then remain that Follette&rsquo;s actions seem more in line with benefitting people by and large like taking the hand of the people pointing out the dangers within a forest. Conversely imagine Theodore, or Franklin Roosevelt taking a symbolic hand of banks who then hold the hands of people. In the second hand of banks are the people&rsquo;s house keys, following fallout of bad banking practice. Questionable from this practice is money was borrowed from banks and inefficiency allowed people to value Franklin Roosevelt&rsquo;s plans for direct relief handouts. Unfortunately, many of these handouts invariably ended up being result of bond money from banks creating, at least superficially, a sense that Franklin Roosevelt recapitulated trust structures he was supposedly opposed to. Such contradictory notions Follette regarded as problematic as demonstrating a departure from the values of the Progressive Era. The face appears the same but, the beliefs may not be, &ldquo;a bluejay by any other name is still blue.&rdquo; &ldquo;Compounding this is view of symbolic gesture is when Theodore Roosevelt directly intervened in an anthracite coal strike inviting both sides to the white house.&rdquo; (OpenStax 621) This symbolism of a Progressive Era Roosevelt giving a minor wage increase and slight improvement in working hours to coal miners, relative to the nature of New Deal Franklin Roosevelt&rsquo;s actions having hyperbolically similar disparities from reality of life like not being photographed as handicapped is positing to cause such gesture whether Franklin Roosevelt&rsquo;s or Theodore&rsquo;s to seem curious and perhaps dubious. With research regarding this occurrence this symbolism was very likely a party line politic to insure stability in November elections rather than genuine interest for conditions of Anthracite strikers. Theodore Roosevelt&rsquo;s close friend Henry Cabot Lodge &ldquo;warned the president [Roosevelt] of the potentially disastrous consequences for the party if the anthracite strike dragged into November.&rdquo; (Anthracite) During these negotiations banker J. P. Morgan was involved strengthening doubt of rhetoric that the New Era was really new as the antitrust campaigner of the time was in capacity working alongside a trust boss furthering agenda of political stability. Though these be two different Roosevelt&rsquo;s the actions and campaign ideas relative to the relationships and structures they conduct themselves within give reason to believe is a view as transparent as muddied water.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'><span style="color:#222222;background:white;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A dissatisfying for sake of comparison positing this lack of &ldquo;newness&rdquo; is though during either era not much change for African Americans or women was achieved. Though more change during the New Era benefitted both African Americans and Women Suffragists. As is often nature of change with persistence like a river coursing over rocks. With enough time a river will erode, smooth, and dissolve a rock similarly that could be remarked regarding African Americans and Women succeeding during The New Deal Era though circumstances be more dynamic than simplification of a river to a rock. Exemplary of this dubious state is during the New Deal Era many of Franklin Roosevelt&rsquo;s programs that attempted to stimulate change for African Americans and Women were as mentioned prior handouts or for African Americans referred to dubiously as &ldquo;The Negro Run Around [or] Negros Ruined Again&rdquo; (OpenStax 778) is a play on one of Roosevelt&rsquo;s programs listed as the NRA. Unfortunately supporting this belief of politically motivated actions harkens recognition that antebellum and red shirt rhetoric takes part in congressional decision making. Harkening such as this would then give reason to believe arguments regarding antitrust could be politically motivated as well. To this end is believed the Progressive Era was a greater success than the New Deal Era as during the Progressive Era La Follette and Upton Sinclair were vocal influencers of Roosevelt and the populace politically by virtue of popularity and common sense reason. Additionally, previously mentioned La Follette also offered the 5<sup>th</sup> longest filibuster as of 5-15-2019 regarding matters regarding antitrust particularly the Aldrich Vreeland act that later devastated the American economy requiring a bailout from the government. &ldquo;Fear that the United States would abandon the gold standard pushed the value of the dollar to unprecedented depths on world markets, the magnitude of the problem forced America to defend itself.&rdquo; (Silber 285) Unfortunately resoundingly apparent is that like the events of the Gilded Age where standards of monetization crippled poor farmers, &nbsp;governmental incentives did not aid small farmers such as African Americans, and voices of acknowledgment were limited is then demonstrable that for marginalized people government politics really only saw true signs of opposition to corruption in form at very least by the one of the longest filibusters in history during the Progressive Era. Is important to note this alongside African American and Women Suffrage history as both groups were and are directly impacted by the nature of such amassing of power. Is impossible to discuss constructs of power without relating whom are most impacted by lack of access to such power such as was often the case with African Americans and Women during both New Deal Era and Progressive Era politics.</span></p>
<p style='margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'><span style="color:#222222;background:white;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Though is not a very stark contrast between Progressive and New Deal is apparent by virtue of La Follette that political pressure was placed during Progressive Era to enact positive change for the nature of fiduciary management. Perhaps ahead of his time La Follette pointedly recognized context of monetary standards. Monetary standards such as the gold standard being enacted would release money but that money would not alleviate the ills of society then, and is evidenced by following legacy of Great Depression and Franklin Roosevelts attempts at alleviating sorrows of the oft reportedly beleaguered farmers of America that it wouldn&rsquo;t later. Perhaps is a kindness to such dubiousness, perhaps is the greatest of intentions, great expectations, such is the nature of confidence inspiring fireside chats. Theodore Roosevelt was reportedly greatly influenced by Upton Sinclair&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Jungle&rdquo; yet Upton Sinclair had one major criticism regarding the impact of his book.&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I aimed at the public&rsquo;s heart, and by accident I hit it in the stomach,&rdquo; he concluded with frustration.&rdquo; (OpenStax 622) Perhaps like the aims of the antitrust representatives of these Era&rsquo;s they too aimed for the Heart of America but, unfortunately, they hit the stomachs. Unfortunately, to really sway people is not to hit the heart without hitting the brain. To this end the case of destroying surplus food to artificially control prices, that hit the stomach was not figural so much as literal. That hit to the stomach also then hits the brain but, not quite literally, or positively as a starved body has a starved mind. So, perhaps all that was not hit is the heart, it was soothed into abuse, like a Stockholm syndrome victim. Like the Shirtwaist fires, many would suffer before significant change would be made an though neither Era was particularly the greatest seems the Progressive Era was somewhat better for the likes of Upton Sinclair and La Follette.</p>
