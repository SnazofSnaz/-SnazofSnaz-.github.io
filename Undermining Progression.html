        <p>Progression Undermined, A Dubious Observation</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mla-content">
        <p>The goals of many 20<sup>th</sup> century people were motivated by at least face value to improve quality of life for all American People. Though there were some antebellum persons hailing to better times of hierarchy or grandiose sensibilities; many committed to improving quality of life for all. Relatively, degrees of success regarding these aims can be considerably debated regarding not extent of improvements made so much as the equity of such improvement. Two eras of interest during this century are the Progressive Era and the New Deal Era. The Progressive Era was earmarked by widespread social activism and reform of politics due to an overall sense of political corruption or developmental infrastructure problems associated with modernization such as industrialization. Through the Progressive Era much was accomplished though with many missteps &ndash; though should be noted is akin to nature of a newborn learning to walk as is the attending of governance to new situations for new governors. Regardless, these steps showed much unrest was deemed needing catharsis during. Some catharsis being result of Upton Sinclair&rsquo;s muckraking of meatpacking industry regarding health and labor standards. La Follette discussing corruption about bribery during his time as a congressman he was &ldquo;<span style="color:black;background:white;">extremely critical of the behaviour of some of the party bosses</span><span style='font-size:14px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black;background:white;'>.&rdquo; (</span><span style="color:black;background:white;">Spartacus</span><span style='font-size:14px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black;background:white;'>) for</span> offering bribes to fix court cases and questioned monopolies of the time relative to such actions. Unfortunately, not all circumstances began being addressed preventatively. Events relating to worker safety such as the Shirtwaist fires causing death and dismay were often what invoked final change for this era when unheeded complaints relented to loss of life. These are just some examples of an era fraught with the tumult of promise inherent to uncertainty. Similarly, The New Deal Era was an Era of great interest. A brief example to perceive much of this era was President Roosevelt&rsquo;s presidency where no photographs feature him wheelchair bound for fear of causing a loss of confidence for a beleaguered time. &ldquo;he never wanted to be photographed in his wheelchair or appear infirm in any way, for fear that the public&rsquo;s sympathy would transform into concern over his physical ability to discharge the duties.&rdquo; (OpenStax 759) If to examine a time where shows of confidence were most important is symbolism rendered by acts such as this. During this time such ceremony continued with leg braces hidden under trousers to aid such public image. During this time Roosevelt was a prime proponent to allaying fears by in some instances discontinuing policies of the Gilded Age, a lead up to the Depression. This allaying was through &ldquo;fireside chats&rdquo; discussing the events for departing from the gold standard towards the silver standard regarding monetization and reduction of bank privileges with deposit funds as with the Glass-Steagall Act. &nbsp;Though much was improved some concerns of this era showcased are events like the bonus army march on Washington. Like many shows of confidence proof remains in the pudding and believing in change is not always enough. &nbsp; As if the Bonus Army had asked Roosevelt to stand upright too soon, without preparation of his legs via his specialized trousers, this army had asked the government to pay a fee ahead of schedule and saw kindly, yet dogged removal as a result. Needless to point out the event of such a rushed president essentially paralleled the result of the Bonus Army action. <u>Comparatively these eras were both difficult though is clear the Progressive Era was more successful as it directed its attention and actions directly to problems of the time to inspire confidence. New Deal Era would be known to artificially inspire confidence while not diminishing reasons reducing root causes of confidence diminishment.&nbsp;</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A prime example relating to acts to develop confidence while not removing basis for unconfident populace is the act of destroying food to artificially inflate farm prices. Confidence generally results from good conscience policies so is only fitting &ldquo;critics saw it as the ultimate example of corrupt capitalism: a government destroying food, while its citizens were starving, in order to drive up prices.&rdquo; (OpenStax 767) coupled with events of the Bonus Army march this era just seems disastrously disconnected in spirit from intent. Appears as a result this era was plagued with the problems sought to be addressed by The Progressive Era but instead remained focus upon fiscal numerics rather than quality of life essentials. When examining these two events, Bonus Army removal and agricultural surplus destruction coupled with knowledge of inflationary pressures what becomes evident is this era was more so about economic control rather than quality of life improvement; a stark though not explicit contrast to the former Progressive Era. The Progressive Era meant so much more for accountability by focusing on reducing inefficiency, waste, and corruption. When considering that most subsidies of the New Deal for farmers went to Large Factory farms; would only seem notable that the biggest benefiters affording such loss of supply would be large farms. Benefitting most from incremental price increase would be those who could afford such loss with supply remaining for sale. Such actions of inefficiency would be in direct contradiction to the aims and actions of Progressive Era activists who actively rooted out such behavior. Appears The New Deal Era meagerly attempted such similar stance as the Progressive Era&rsquo;s. A major component of such assessment is how text cites New Deal policies &ldquo;put capital into ailing banks, [it] rescued homeowners and farmers from foreclosure and helped people keep their homes&rdquo; (OpenStax 771). Such distinctions when removed from framings in terms of economics showcases how people believed in the American financial system that was also positioned to of crippled them. This positioning representative of a mouse believing a snake has comfort to offer. Though Roosevelt initiated Glass Steagall to return good faith to the American financial system when considering actions of this time supported larger entities such as Corporations or large farms to small business and small farms appears contradiction is apparent. Though at face value deals of this time seemed intent to aid disenfranchised the methods of employ seem but always less likely to accomplish such effect.</p>
        <p>Contrary to implications of economic degeneration and narrow focus or channeling of economic development through banks rather than distributing excess farm supply as economic currency is Robert La Follette. &ldquo;Robert La Follette the son of a small farmer&hellip; Was successful in persuading the federal government to introduce much needed reforms.&rdquo; (Spartacus) Unfortunately relations, especially political relations are described as very dynamic. &ldquo;<span style="color:#222222;background:white;">initially [Follette] enjoyed warm relations with President Roosevelt, La Follette soured somewhat on the president after Roosevelt declined to support some progressive measures&rdquo; (Thelen 60-61). Given the characterization of Follette as being from a small farm, a proponent of antitrust laws regarding monopolies by mob bosses such as Rockefeller, and his desired accomplishment towards supporting railroad workers rights seems the Progressive Era that Follette most distinctly resembles as a Progressive Himself was far more successful as it suited the needs of American&rsquo;s &nbsp;more than Roosevelt&rsquo;s an by extension the New Deal Era symbolized through their relation. Additionally, given the nature of Roosevelt&rsquo;s criticism inefficiency regarding destruction of surplus farm supply while utilizing banks was Follette arguing panic was induced by banks, particularly large corporations. Follette&rsquo;s positing a relationship of panic as means of orchestrating economic benefit to large corporations is not unknown to La Follette and paralleled contemporarily as is notable by Naomi Klein&rsquo;s <em>Shock Doctrine</em> regarding survivors of Hurricane Katrina. This shock, or panic as referred to by Follette relative to actions of Roosevelt causes a sense that not is all what it seems an should be of concern. Echo</p>
